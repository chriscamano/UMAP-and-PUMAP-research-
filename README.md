# UMAP-and-PUMAP-research-
This repository of the research and development log of work on the Uniform Manifold Approximate Projection method (UMAP). Special emphasis placed on exploring the underyling 
behavior of UMAP and other dimensionality reduction schemes in the presence of symmetry augmentations in the input space. This research is a continuation of a generalized exploration into dimensionality reduction schemes started in the Spring of 2021. For information about that research such as past notebooks, figures, or experimental data please reach out to me for a copy. 

This work is funded by the CSU-LSAMP-NSF research grant, and San Francisco State University under the guidance of Dr. Daniel Huang.
